Erase your social media profiles

![Suicidebooth](Suicidebooth.webp)

## Description
Quick script i wrote to either hide or archive all the post under your timeline in facebook.

## How to use:
- On a desktop browser (tested on Brave) open developer tools
- On the devices options, select Iphone SE (any other phone size should work aswell)
- Go to your facebook profile timeline
- Open the console and copy the index.js contents on it
- Sit and relax (only supporting "slow and horrible" mode for now, if the script stops, just write archiveOrHide() in your console to resume)
